We believe that Jesus reveals to us the best and clearest picture of who God is—and that’s really good news. As God on earth, Jesus came to show us God’s love, save us from sin, set up God’s kingdom, and shut down religion so we can share in God’s life, together. If you’re starting to ask questions about spirituality and faith, we think Jesus is the best place to start. Check out some of the videos, podcasts, and blogs below.",
