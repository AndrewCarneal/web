When you give, you become a participant in a counter-cultural movement of disciples who want to transform their neighbourhoods and cities by helping grow loving communities of Jesus-followers who live and share his irreligious message. Your giving makes a difference in the lives of others, and in your own life. This is our collective purpose—this is why we exist. Your donations make this a tangible reality. Thank you."
